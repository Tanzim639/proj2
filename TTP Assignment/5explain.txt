Explanation of question 5:
This code is designed to find the equation of a plane that passes through a given point (a, b, c) and is parallel to another plane defined by its direction numbers (d, e, f).
Here's a step-by-step explanation:
The program starts by printing a question prompt to inform the user about the problem it's solving.
The program then declares and initializes six double variables: a, b, c (representing the coordinates of a point on the plane), and d, e, f (representing the direction numbers of the parallel plane).
The user is prompted to input the values of these variables.
The program calculates the constant term in the equation of the plane using the formula: constant = -(a * d) - (b * e) - (c * f).
Finally, the program prints the equation of the plane in the form dx + ey + fz + constant = 0. The coefficients (d, e, f) are printed as they are, and signs in front of e and f are adjusted based on whether they are positive or negative. The constant term is also printed with its sign adjusted.
